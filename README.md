# IV Planner & Connector

## 📌 Problem Statement
Planning Industrial Visits (IVs) in colleges is often a manual, time-consuming, and unstructured process. Colleges struggle to coordinate with industries, track availability, manage approvals, and communicate updates effectively. Students also lack a centralized platform to explore IVs, internships, and mentorship opportunities.

There is a need for a **centralized system** that connects **students, colleges, and service providers** to simplify IV planning and coordination.

It enables colleges to plan and manage IVs, service providers to publish availability and opportunities, and students to explore and apply for IVs and related programs — all in one place.
